# Encrypted Password Manager
The project generates password for given websites and stores them in a file encrypted with AES 256 key in counter mode. It uses a master password and a salt value to generate the key and initialization vector. To generate the key and initialization vector the project uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). A 256-bit key and 128-bit initialization vector are created through PBKDF2. The website and itâ€™s password are stored as a json object in the memory encode in utf-8 format. Then, the json object is encrypted by AES and stored in the password file. When a password for given website is already stored in the password file then upon receiving a website name the project retrieves the password from the password file. Then the password is decoded to json object by decoding utf-8 format. After that, AES decryption is being done and the password is shown in plain text along with the website name. The project uses python 3 and needs pycryptodome library to run. The project execution flow is given below.

When running the project, it requires a website. It will ask repeatedly until a website name is given like below.

After that, it will ask for a master password which is shown in the figure below.

Then a random password for that particular website is created, encrypted and stored in the password database file. If there is no database file exits then it creates a database file and then stores the password. A screenshot for the scenario is shown in the figure below.

When the program is run with the same website again, it retrieves the password, decrypts it and shows it to the user. A screenshot is shown in the figure below.

In case if the user enters wrong master password it shows warning message and stops the program which is shown in the figure below.

The program works the same way for any other website as it does for the first website. A screenshot for storing password for a different website in the same database is shown in the figure below.
